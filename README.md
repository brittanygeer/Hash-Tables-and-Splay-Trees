# Hash-Tables-and-Splay-Trees
A project led by the instructional team of CS 251 at Purdue University. Implements a hash table, a splay tree, and then combines them into an adaptive hash table that uses splay trees for collision management.

I worked on the implmentation in three files: hash_map.hpp, splay_tree.hpp, and adaptive_hash_map.hpp. The skeleton code was created by the CS251 instructional team.

Part 1: Hash Table with Open Addressing (Linear Probing):

Implements a hash table in hash_map.hpp that uses linear probing to avoid collision.

Part 2: Splay Tree:

Implmenets a splay tree, a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed
elements are quick to access again, in splay_tree.hpp.

Part 3: Adaptive Hash Table with Splay Tree:

In adaptive_hash_map.hpp, creates an adaptive hash table that uses splay trees for collision management.
